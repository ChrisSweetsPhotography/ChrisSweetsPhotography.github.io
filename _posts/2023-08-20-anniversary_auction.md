[This auction](https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1980-datsun-280zx-40/) was a record setter for Datsun 280ZX Anniversary Cars. And to understand why, we first need to understand a bit more about what the 10th Anniversary Datsun 280ZX is, and what made this one so special.

Datsun, known today as Nissan, was the Americanized name for the fledging Japanese automotive company. Much of their early success in America is due to the Z-Car. Started in the 1970 model year with the 240Z, the Z-Car provided Americans with a lightweight sportscar, powered by a brawny 2.4L inline 6 cylinder. As the years progressed the motor grew in displacement to 2.8L and ditched carburation for fuel injection, among many other changes. To celebrate the 10th Anniversary of the Z-Car in America, Datsun decided to produce a limited run of "Anniversary" Cars. These cars featured two color options; Black and Gold, of which there was 2500; and Red and Gold, of which there was 500.

This particular car was a glowing success at auction due to several factors:

1. The car was a part of a limited production run from the onset
2. This car was well cared for by previous owners
3. The selling owners ensured that the car was looking its best for auction by having the car professionally detailed and having paintless dent repair performed.
4. The selling owners requested additional photos be taken with an extra set of rims, as well as paint meter readings around the car
