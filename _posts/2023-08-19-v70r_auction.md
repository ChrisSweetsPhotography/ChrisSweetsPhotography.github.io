The Volvo V70R is a little known hot hatchback. In an era where the hot hatch is seeing a rebirth from the likes of Hyundai, Toyota, and others, it may be easy to question why one would be interested in a Volvo V70R. The answer, simply put, is uniqueness. The aesthetics are uniquely boxy in the rear, with long drawn out tail-lights, while looking silently sporty in the front. The interior features an attractive blue guage cluster, comfortable leather seats, and doesn't rattle or squeak, even 10 years into it's life. The powertrain is a turbo-charged 5 Cylinder, the likes of which are rarely seen anymore. And the V70R is larger than any of the current hot hatch offerings, providing a higher degree of usability and practicality for day to day life, while still being fun to drive!
