Datsun, known today as Nissan, was the Americanized name for the fledging Japanese automotive company. Much of their early success in America is due to the Z-Car. Started in the 1970 model year with the 240Z, the Z-Car provided Americans with a lightweight sportscar, powered by a brawny 2.4L inline 6 cylinder. The Z-Car defied expectation, as at the time a Japanese automaker producing a desirable sportscar was unthinkable to most. The car became a widespread success, known for its handling, modifiability, and versatility.

In addition to producing a rock solic sportscar, Datsun created an ethos around their cars. To this day, many remember the slogan, "Datsun: We Are Driven". That slogan rings true with this particular example. This car was driven, and it has minor imperfections to show it. But with the right prep work it still shows as a beautiful car, and is ready for auction!
