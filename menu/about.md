## Who I Am:
Chris Sweet's Photography is a Rochester NY based company for all your auction photography needs. I have specialized in automotive photography for 5+ years and am an enthusiast through and through. I use my passion to work directly with you, ensuring that your car is represented at it's best for sale on sites like Bring A Trailer, Cars and Bids, and Hagerty Marketplace. I enjoy learning about each car and telling it's story through photography.

## What I Do:
First, I will work with you to find a suitable time and location for shooting the car. I am willing to travel throughout the Western NY region, though will consider further travel on a case by case basis. I bring shooting lights, multiple lenses, and quick detailer spray to all photo shoots to address any small details (e.g. Bug Splatter from transitioning between shooting locations).

I will also work with you to determine an optimal schedule for your photo shoot. A typical schedule may look like:

* Meet at Garage at 0900
* Put Car on Lift/Jack Stands and Take Underside Shots
* Lower Car and Take Engine Bay Shots
* Record Cold Start Video
* Transition to Exterior Shooting Location
* Shoot all Exterior, Interior, and Documentation Photos
* Record Driving and Walkaround Video

After shooting, I will go through all of the photos and edit them for color balance, exposure, clarity, etc. Once all photos are "auction-ready" I will create a link and share with you via Google Photos: this preserves the photo quality and shows your car at it's best. Alongside this link I will share recommendations for what picture I think is best suited as the cover photo for you car's auction. 

## What I Ask of You:
Please have the car ready to be displayed for auction. Many customers choose to have their car professionally detailed prior to having auction photos taken. This is also a wonderful time to have any paintless dent repair performed.

Please also make sure that you have all documentation, spare parts, etc that you would like shot in addition to the car.
